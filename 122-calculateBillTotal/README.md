# `122` calculateBillTotal

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a function called `calculateBillTotal`.

Given the amount of taxes and tip of a meal, `calculateBillTotal` returns the total amount due after paying taxes and tips.

## 💡 Hint:

* Suppose that sales tax is `9.5%` and tip is `15%`.

* DO NOT tip the sales tax, only the amount of the tip corresponding to the amount before tax.

## Expected result:

```Js
var output = calculateBillTotal(20);
console.log(output); // --> 24.9
```
