# `79` joinThreeArrays

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a function called `joinThreeArrays`.

Given three arrays, `joinThreeArrays` returns an array with the elements of `arr1` in order followed by the elements in `arr2` in order followed by the elements of `arr3` in order.

```Javascript
var output = joinThreeArrays([1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]);
console.log(output); // --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
## :bulb: Hint:

+ You should be familiar with the `concat` method for this problem.
