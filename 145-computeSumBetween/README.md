# `145` computeSumBetween

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a function called `computeSumBetween`.

Given 2 integers, `computeSumBetween` returns the sum between the two given integers, beginning at `num1`, and excluding `num2`.

## :bulb: Hint:

* The sum between `1` and `4` is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.

* If `num2` is not greater than num1, it should return `0`.

```Js
var output = computeSumBetween(2, 5);
console.log(output); // --> 9
```
